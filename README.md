# refactor-project
I refactored the source code for this project.
The source code now includes semantic html elements.
There is also an appropriate title element.
Accessible alt elements have been added

CSS
I commented on the types of CSS  selectors used
Also I reformatted some classes by making use of multiple classes to reduce redundancy
